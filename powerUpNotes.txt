NOTES FOR DOLAN, WINTON, LAUREN (15/9/21):
Alright, firstly I haven't updated the Saver or Loader classes to parse the
Power Ups, but I did write some stuff that places them on their own layer in
Composition and draws them. So your first task will probs be to do that...
I didn't do it honestly out of laziness...

If you want layout fixes/changes let me know. The current system is soooo
whack, it basically just works off a list of values and makes them sequentially,
not exactly fine gui design.

In terms of adding new Power Ups, that stuff I tried to simplify a lot.
You will need to append to 3 enums for all the functionality:
- BrushType
- SubSpr
- ActiveEntityButtons (located in the ToolBox class)

BrushType is the real juicy one, make sure to set the layers right
and use unique values for the "type" and "setting" arguments. Otherwise,
if you implement correctly, it should work like a charm.

SubSpr is used to get the top left corner of the sprite on the spritesheet.
All sprites are 8x8 so the icon maker automatically gets all that stuff.

ActiveEntityButtons will allow the user to set the brush setting from a button
that represents the new PowerUp. This is purely graphical, and functionality will
exist without this.
